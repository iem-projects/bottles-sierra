Bottles for macOS/sierra

## What is this?
This project is an attempt to provide bottles for some formulae
we need for building software on "sierra" build bots.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install iem-projects/sierra/<formula>`

Or `brew tap iem-projects/sierra` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```

```
